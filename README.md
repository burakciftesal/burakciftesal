# 👋 Hi, I'm Burak Ciftesal!

🎓 I'm an **Applied Mathematics MSc graduate** with a specialization in **Applied Analysis**. I currently work as a **Data Scientist / Data Analyst**, and I’m passionate about blending mathematical rigor with real-world applications — from dynamic systems and machine learning to financial modeling and biological data analysis. My focus is on making sense of complex, messy data and turning it into meaningful insights through both theoretical and computational approaches.

## 🚀 About Me

- 📊 I work on transforming raw, unstructured data into meaningful insights and models.
- 🎓 I hold an MSc in **Applied Mathematics**, specializing in **Applied Analysis**. My thesis, titled **"Isolation in Epidemic Models"**, focused on **dynamic modeling** of infectious disease spread using differential equations and simulation techniques. Through this, I also developed a solid background in **bioinformatics**.
- 🧮 I’ve worked extensively with **mathematical modeling** and **applied analysis**, building and analyzing both **continuous and discrete dynamical systems**. My projects cover a variety of domains — from epidemic modeling and urban sensor networks to behavioral analysis, GPS triangulation, and real-world decision systems — combining both theoretical frameworks and computational techniques.  
  I also build and apply **machine learning models**, including both **supervised** and **unsupervised** approaches for tasks like anomaly detection, classification, and behavior modeling.  
  In addition, I’ve created **chatbots**, worked on **SEO-friendly blogging platforms**, and developed end-to-end solutions that combine data, algorithms, and user interaction.
- 💼 In my professional role, I focus on **financial data modeling**, detecting behavioral patterns, optimizing system performance, and identifying anomalies in transactional data.
